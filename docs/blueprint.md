- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF), reflecting trust and clear communication.
- Background color: Light sky blue (#B0E2FF), a desaturated shade of the primary to provide a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) to bring a touch of elegance and denote interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to ensure a modern, clean and neutral aesthetic throughout the application, optimized for screen readability.
- Use minimalist and consistent icons to represent key functions like mute, share screen, and chat.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with a focus on easy navigation and user accessibility. The video conference screen should prioritize the speaker's feed while allowing easy access to other participants and features.
- Implement subtle animations to provide feedback on user interactions, such as button presses and screen transitions. Animations should be smooth and unobtrusive to avoid distracting from the video conference.
